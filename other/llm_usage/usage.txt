Here’s how to structure the start of your Quarto document to load the final_analysis_data.parquet file and ensure it's available for use throughout the document. The data is then displayed in the relevant section.

Start of the Quarto Document
At the beginning of your Quarto document, include a hidden code block to load the final_analysis_data.parquet file:

markdown
Copy code
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Load necessary libraries
library(arrow)   # For reading Parquet files
library(dplyr)   # For data manipulation
library(knitr)   # For table rendering
library(kableExtra) # For styled tables

# Define the path to the final analysis data
file_path <- "data/processed_data/final_analysis_data.parquet"

# Load the final analysis data
final_data <- read_parquet(file_path)

# Preview the first few rows in case of debugging (optional, remove in final)
head(final_data)
python
Copy code

### Display the Final Analysis Data Later in the Document

In the relevant section, display a sample of the data:

```markdown
## Structuring the Final Dataset

The cleaned dataset is structured as follows and contains key information for analysis. Below is a random sample of the data for clarity.

```{r tbl-analysis-sample}
#| label: tbl-analysis-sample
#| tbl-cap: "Sample of Analysis Data"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Randomly sample 5 rows from the final data
sample_data <- final_data %>%
  sample_n(5)

# Clean column names for display
colnames(sample_data) <- c("Player", "Player Type", "Match Type", "Strike Rate", "Total Balls Faced")

# Render table
knitr::kable(sample_data, caption = "Sample of Analysis Data", align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
markdown
Copy code

### Notes:
1. **File Path**: Ensure that `file_path` points to the correct location of `final_analysis_data.parquet`.
2. **Random Sampling**: The `sample_n(5)` function ensures that the displayed rows are random, giving a dynamic view of the data each time the document is compiled.
3. **Column Formatting**: Column names are cleaned for clarity, with underscores removed and proper capitalization applied.
4. **Table Styling**: `kableExtra` is used to provide professional styling to the table.

This setup ensures that the data is loaded at the start of the document, making it accessible for analysis and display later in the document.

The issue is likely due to an incorrect file path in your Quarto document for loading the final_analysis_data.parquet file. The path should match exactly where the file is located on your system. Based on your screenshot, the file is located in:

plaintext
Copy code
Downloads/Top-100-Batters-T20-to-ODI-Strike-Rate-Mapping/data/processed_data/final_analysis_data.parquet
Ensure that your Quarto document includes the full and correct relative or absolute path to this file. For example:

Correcting the Path in Quarto
If your working directory is the project root (where the Top-100-Batters-T20-to-ODI-Strike-Rate-Mapping folder is located):

r
Copy code
file_path <- "data/processed_data/final_analysis_data.parquet"
If your working directory is inside the data/processed_data folder:

r
Copy code
file_path <- "final_analysis_data.parquet"
If none of these align with your project setup, you may need to set the absolute path:

r
Copy code
file_path <- "/Users/your_username/Downloads/Top-100-Batters-T20-to-ODI-Strike-Rate-Mapping/data/processed_data/final_analysis_data.parquet"
Debugging the Issue
Double-check your working directory in RStudio or by running getwd() in the console to confirm the base directory.
Add a print statement in the Quarto chunk to ensure the file path is being recognized correctly:
r
Copy code
print(file_path)
Once the path is correctly set, the file should load without errors.

this is the script where we write the final data; how do i use this to call and load it into the quarto doc

# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(arrow)  # For saving and reading Parquet files

# Define thresholds
threshold_t20 <- 200   # Minimum balls faced in T20 matches
threshold_odi <- 500   # Minimum balls faced in ODI matches
combined_threshold <- 700  # Minimum balls faced across both formats

# Step 1: Filter players meeting individual and combined thresholds
filtered_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(
    (match_type == "T20" & total_balls >= threshold_t20) | 
      (match_type == "ODI" & total_balls >= threshold_odi)
  ) %>%
  group_by(striker) %>%
  summarise(
    total_balls_faced = sum(total_balls),  # Total balls faced across formats
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  filter(total_balls_faced >= combined_threshold) %>%
  inner_join(cleaned_data, by = "striker")  # Rejoin the data to include strike rates

# Step 2: Calculate performance metrics for each player
# - Include average strike rates for T20 and ODI formats
average_strike_rate <- filtered_data %>%
  group_by(striker) %>%
  summarise(
    t20_strike_rate = round(mean(strike_rate[match_type == "T20"], na.rm = TRUE), 2),  # Average T20 strike rate
    odi_strike_rate = round(mean(strike_rate[match_type == "ODI"], na.rm = TRUE), 2),  # Average ODI strike rate
    total_balls_faced = sum(total_balls),  # Total balls faced across formats
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Step 3: Rank players and assign player type
player_rankings <- average_strike_rate %>%
  arrange(desc((t20_strike_rate + odi_strike_rate) / 2)) %>%  # Rank by combined strike rates
  mutate(
    player_rank = row_number(),
    player_type = ifelse(player_rank <= 100, "Top 100", "Non-Top 100")  # Categorize players
  )

# Step 4: Finalize the data structure
# Merge player type information into the average_strike_rate dataset
final_data <- average_strike_rate %>%
  left_join(player_rankings %>% select(striker, player_type), by = "striker") %>%
  # Remove rows with NA in either T20 or ODI strike rates
  filter(!is.na(t20_strike_rate) & !is.na(odi_strike_rate))

# Save the final dataset
processed_data_dir <- "data/processed_data"
if (!dir.exists(processed_data_dir)) {
  dir.create(processed_data_dir, recursive = TRUE)
}

parquet_file_path <- file.path(processed_data_dir, "final_analysis_data.parquet")
write_parquet(final_data, parquet_file_path)

cat("Final cleaned data with NA values removed saved to '", parquet_file_path, "'.\n", sep = "")

To call and load the final_analysis_data.parquet file in your Quarto document, follow these steps:

1. Add a Chunk to Load the Data
At the beginning of your Quarto document, include a code chunk that loads the arrow library and reads the Parquet file. Here's how you can structure it:

r
Copy code
```{r setup-load-final-data, include = FALSE}
# Load required libraries
library(arrow)

# Define the path to the Parquet file
file_path <- "data/processed_data/final_analysis_data.parquet"

# Load the final analysis data
final_data <- read_parquet(file_path)

# Verify the data is loaded
print(head(final_data, 3))
vbnet
Copy code

### 2. Confirm the File Path

Ensure that the `file_path` in the script points correctly to the `final_analysis_data.parquet` file's location relative to your working directory. For example:

- If your working directory is the project root and the data folder is under `data/processed_data`, the relative path `data/processed_data/final_analysis_data.parquet` should work.
- If this doesn't work, use an absolute path:
  ```r
  file_path <- "/Users/your_username/Downloads/Top-100-Batters-T20-to-ODI-Strike-Rate-Mapping/data/processed_data/final_analysis_data.parquet"
3. Reference final_data in Subsequent Sections
You can now use the final_data variable wherever you need in your Quarto document. For example, to display a table of random rows:

r
Copy code
```{r tbl-final-analysis-sample, echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

# Randomly select 3 rows to display
sample_rows <- final_data %>% slice_sample(n = 3)

# Display the sample
knitr::kable(sample_rows, caption = "Sample of Final Analysis Data")
csharp
Copy code

### 4. Explanation in the Document

In the `Data` section of your document, explain that this code block is used to load the final analysis data from the processed dataset saved in Parquet format. This ensures that the document is self-contained and reproducible.

By using these steps, you keep the `final_analysis_data.parquet` file external but fully integrate it into your analysis and reporting workflow.

# Introduction

The sport of cricket has evolved greatly in recent times. Traditionally played over the course of 5 days, new, shorter formats are becoming increasingly popular due to their accessibility and faster pace of play. One Day International (ODI) and T20 formats are foremost among these formats - consisting of one innings of 50 overs and 20 overs respectively for either side. [@icc_three] All three formats, Test, ODI, and T20 present different challenges and require different skill-sets. Lasting 5 days, test matches require endurance, patience and strategy. In comparison, T20 cricket is much more exciting, with batsmen 'aiming for boundaries' as the teams try to score as many runs as possible in this short format. ODI cricket is a balance of the two - while relatively fast, strategy is key and slower play is more prevalent. [@behind] 

A batter's strike rate is a key performance indicator of their ability to score runs. It is defined as the 'runs per 100 balls' they face. [@sportmakers] For example, if a batter scores 100 runs in 50 balls, their strike rate can be calculated to be 200. Given the differences in strategy between formats, it is common to expect differences in strike rates. Longer formats generally have lower strike rates, and shorter formats higher. But how well do strike rates translate across formats, particularly for top-performing players compared to the rest of field? This is of particular interest, not only in evaluating individual player adaptability, but in understanding how skills in one format can be extrapolated to another.

This paper aims to investigate whether how well strike rates translate from T20 to ODI formats, for top-performing players compared to their peers. Specifically, we aim to estimate the difference in ODI strike rate attributable to 1) T20 Strike Rates, 2) Player Group (whether they are a top performing batter or not), and 3) the interaction between the two factors. Our estimate is the conditional effect of T20 Strike Rate on ODI Strike Rate, adjusted for player type, while accounting for player-specific variability.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Data Selection and Sourcing

Data used in this paper has been sourced from the reputable cricket database, CricSheet, [@cricsheet]. Created by Stephen Rushe, CricSheet is an open-source platform providing detail ball-by-ball data for 17,944 cricket matches. Contained in the database were 2,858 One Day International matches and 3,856 T20 International matches. This paper focuses on the male cricket matches, with 2,391 Male ODIs and 2,499 Male T20 match data downloaded as CSV files. This data set is particularly well-suited for this study because it ensures consistent measurement across matches, detailed coverage of player-level performance, and a large sample size, enabling robust statistical analysis of performance differences across formats.

Additional details on the data selection process and a step-by-step guide to access and download the data are provided in [@sec-data-details].

## Raw Data

Below are samples from the raw data regarding ODI matches after all raw csv files of individual match data were combined. The data is split into logical groups for clarity, but are all part of the same data frame.

### Match Information

@tbl-raw1 contains basic information about the match: match ID, season, start date, venue, innings, and ball. So, the first row would give match information of Match ID 1131279 at the ICC Academy in the 2017/2018 season, on the 1st of January 2023. The ball that the data captured is the 4th ball from the 44th over, in the first innings.

{r}
#| label: tbl-raw1
#| tbl-cap: "Raw Data - Sample Match Information"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Display match information
knitr::kable(match_info, row.names = FALSE)


### Batting and Bowling Teams
@tbl-raw2 is about the batting team, bowling team, and key players involved at the time of the delivery. The first row can be understood to show that the time of delivery 44.4 of Match 1131279 (correponding to row 1 in @tbl-raw1), the batting team is India, the bowling team is New Zealand, the Striker is V Kohli, the other batsman (or the non-striker) is SS Iyer, and the Bowler is TA Boult. 
{r}
#| label: tbl-raw2
#| tbl-cap: "Raw Data - Sample Batting and Bowling Teams Information"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Display batting and bowling teams information
knitr::kable(bat_bowl_info, row.names = FALSE)


### Runs and Extras
@tbl-raw3 contains the runs scored, extras such as wides, no-balls, byes, leg-byes, and penalties. So for the same ball in @tbl-raw1 and @tbl-raw2, 1 run was scored by V Kohli. There were no extras, wides, no balls, byes, legbyes, or penalties.
{r}
#| label: tbl-raw3
#| tbl-cap: "Raw Data - Sample Runs and Extras Information"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Display runs and extras information
knitr::kable(runs_extras_info, row.names = FALSE)


### Wicket Details
@tbl-raw4 contains information about wickets, including the type of dismissal and the players involved. For each of the 3 balls displayed in this sample there were no wickets or players dismissed.
{r}
#| label: tbl-raw4
#| tbl-cap: "Raw Data - Sample Wicket Details"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Display wicket details information
knitr::kable(wicket_info, row.names = FALSE)



## Cleaning 

### Desired Structure of Analysis Data
Refer to the "Sketches" section of the repository. There was an understanding of how the dataset needed to be transformed in order to get it ready for analysis through our model. he desired structure of the data aimed to include the following key variables: player name, player type, match type, strike rate, and total balls faced. Below is an example of a representation of the desired structure:

{r}
#| label: tbl-desired
#| tbl-cap: "Desired Structure of Analysis Data"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Example of the desired table structure
desired_structure <- data.frame(
  Player = c("Player A", "Player A", "Player B", "Player B"),
  Player_Type = c("Top 100", "Top 100", "Non-Top 100", "Non-Top 100"),
  Match_Type = c("T20", "ODI", "T20", "ODI"),
  Strike_Rate = c(140.0, 90.0, 120.0, 75.0),
  Total_Balls_Faced = c(1200, 1200, 800, 800)
)

# Clean column names to remove underscores
colnames(desired_structure) <- gsub("_", " ", colnames(desired_structure))

# Create the table
kable(desired_structure, align = 'lccrr') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")


### Filtering on Balls Faced

The first step after downloading raw data files and combining them into large T20 and ODI ball by ball data files was to filter players who had a large enough sample size across formats. That is to say, only those who meaningfully participated. Importantly we wanted to exclude players whose sample size of balls faced were too few, as these observations could skew the findings from the paper. Therefore, players were required to meet a minimum threshold of 200 balls faced in T20 matches and 500 balls faced in ODI matches. The combined balls faced in both formats needed to be above a threshold of 700. In doing so, we avoid noise from low-sample sizes. The library dplyr, [@R-dplyr], was used to filter and aggregate the data.

### Calculating Average Strike Rates, Identifying Top 100 Players

The 'mean' function was used to calculate the average T20 Strike Rate and average ODI strike rate. Missing or null values were exlcuded using 'na.rm = TRUE'. 

Because part of are model is concerned with differences between top performing players and their peers, we obtain the Top 100 batsmen before y ranking them based on the average of their T20 and ODI strike rates. Here, the 'mutate' function was used to calculate ranks and assign each player as either 'Top 100', or 'Non-Top 100'. 

### Structuring the Final Dataset

The arrow package was used to save the cleaned data set as a Parquet file. [@R-arrow] The final cleaned dataset now included the columns "Player", "Player Type", "Match Type", "Strike Rate", "Total Balls Faced". @tbl-analysis-sample contains a sample of the first 5 rows of the final analysis data.

{r}
#| label: tbl-analysis-sample
#| tbl-cap: "Sample of Analysis Data"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(dplyr)
library(arrow)

# Set the file path
file_path <- "data/processed_data/final_analysis_data.parquet"

# Load the cleaned data
final_analysis_data <- read_parquet(file_path)

# Select a random sample of 5 rows from the final data
sample_data <- final_analysis_data %>%
  sample_n(5)

# Rename columns to improve presentation
colnames(sample_data) <- c("Player", "Player Type", "Match Type", "Strike Rate", "Total Balls Faced")

# Display the sample table
knitr::kable(sample_data, caption = "Sample of Analysis Data")

The issue arises because your Quarto document cannot find the final_analysis_data.parquet file in the specified path. Here's how to ensure that the file is properly loaded:

Correcting the Path to the Parquet File
Verify the File Location: From the screenshots, the final_analysis_data.parquet file is located in the directory:

bash
Copy code
data/processed_data/final_analysis_data.parquet
Use here for Relative Pathing: To ensure consistent file pathing regardless of the working directory, use the here package to specify the file location.

Fix the Loading Script in Quarto: Update the script to ensure the correct path and error handling.

Updated Quarto Code to Load the File
At the start of your Quarto document, update the loading script as follows:

r
Copy code
```{r setup-load-data, include = FALSE}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(arrow)
library(here)
library(knitr)

# Define the path to the Parquet file using `here` for relative pathing
file_path <- here::here("data", "processed_data", "final_analysis_data.parquet")

# Check if the file exists before loading
if (file.exists(file_path)) {
  final_analysis_data <- read_parquet(file_path)
} else {
  stop("Error: Parquet file not found at the specified path: ", file_path)
}

# Confirm data loading
print(head(final_analysis_data, 3))  # Display the first 3 rows to verify
vbnet
Copy code

### Changes Explained:
1. **`here::here`**:
   - Ensures the file path is relative to the project root, avoiding hardcoding or path issues.
2. **`file.exists`**:
   - Checks if the file exists at the specified location and provides a clear error message if not.
3. **`stop` Function**:
   - Halts the execution with an informative error if the file isn't found.
4. **Data Verification**:
   - Prints the first few rows of the loaded data for confirmation during testing.

### Using the Loaded Data in Tables

After ensuring the data is loaded successfully, reference the `final_analysis_data` variable throughout your Quarto document. For example, your "Sample of Analysis Data" section:

```r
```{r tbl-analysis-sample, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Randomly sample 5 rows from the loaded data
sample_data <- final_analysis_data %>%
  sample_n(5)

# Rename columns for clarity
colnames(sample_data) <- c("Player", "Player Type", "Match Type", "Strike Rate", "Total Balls Faced")

# Display the table
knitr::kable(sample_data, caption = "Sample of Analysis Data")
markdown
Copy code

### Testing the Workflow

1. **Run the Document**:
   Render the Quarto document to ensure that the `final_analysis_data.parquet` file loads without errors.
   
2. **Troubleshooting**:
   If the file still isn’t found, double-check:
   - The working directory of the Quarto session.
   - The relative path to the file.
   - That the `arrow` package is installed and working correctly.

### Additional Tips

- Always test file paths by running the script independently in your R session.
- Ensure that all dependencies (`arrow`, `here`, etc.) are installed and loaded correctly.

### Filtering on Balls Faced

The first step after downloading raw data files and combining them into large T20 and ODI ball by ball data files was to filter players who had a large enough sample size across formats. That is to say, only those who meaningfully participated. Importantly we wanted to exclude players whose sample size of balls faced were too few, as these observations could skew the findings from the paper. Therefore, players were required to meet a minimum threshold of 200 balls faced in T20 matches and 500 balls faced in ODI matches. The combined balls faced in both formats needed to be above a threshold of 700. In doing so, we avoid noise from low-sample sizes. The library dplyr, [@R-dplyr], was used to filter and aggregate the data.

### Calculating Average Strike Rates, Identifying Top 100 Players

The 'mean' function was used to calculate the average T20 Strike Rate and average ODI strike rate. Missing or null values were exlcuded using 'na.rm = TRUE'. 

Because part of are model is concerned with differences between top performing players and their peers, we obtain the Top 100 batsmen before y ranking them based on the average of their T20 and ODI strike rates. Here, the 'mutate' function was used to calculate ranks and assign each player as either 'Top 100', or 'Non-Top 100'. 

### Structuring the Final Dataset

The arrow package was used to save the cleaned data set as a Parquet file. [@R-arrow] The final cleaned dataset now included the columns "Player", "Player Type", "Match Type", "Strike Rate", "Total Balls Faced". @tbl-analysis-sample contains a sample of the first 5 rows of the final analysis data.

#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-pos: "H"


remember the columns of the final data set:

"striker", "t20_strike_rate", "odi_strike_rate", "total_balls_faced", "player_type"

Summary of Visualizations and Insights:
Strike Rate Distributions:

T20 strike rates show higher variance and a longer tail compared to ODI strike rates.
Top 100 players generally have higher densities at higher strike rates.
T20 vs. ODI Relationship:

A positive relationship is observed, with some deviation between top 100 and non-top 100 players.
Linear regression lines suggest that top 100 players have a stronger relationship between T20 and ODI strike rates.
Total Balls Faced:

Most players have faced around 700 to 2,000 balls, aligning with the data cleaning thresholds.
The distribution is slightly skewed toward players who faced fewer balls.
Average Strike Rates:

Top 100 players consistently outperform non-top 100 players in both formats.
These exploratory graphs and tables provide a clear understanding of the dataset and serve as a foundation for subsequent modeling analysis.

whats wrong??
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error is happening because the aes mapping for fill = player_type may not be referencing a properly recognized column in the final_data dataset. Here's how to troubleshoot and fix this issue:

Step-by-Step Fix:
Check the Data Structure: Confirm that player_type exists in the final_data dataframe and is a valid categorical variable (factor or character type).

Run the following:

r
Copy code
str(final_data)
head(final_data)
Ensure Column Names Match: If player_type is missing or misspelled in final_data, rename or verify the column names:

r
Copy code
colnames(final_data)
Update the ggplot Code: If the player_type column is present, ensure that it's properly treated as a categorical variable:

r
Copy code
final_data$player_type <- as.factor(final_data$player_type)
Validate Data Before Plotting: Ensure there are no missing values in t20_strike_rate and player_type. Filter if needed:

r
Copy code
final_data <- final_data %>% 
    filter(!is.na(t20_strike_rate), !is.na(player_type))
Modified Plot Code: Here's the updated and validated code:

r
Copy code
#| label: fig-strike-rate-distribution
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of T20 and ODI Strike Rates"
#| fig.width: 6
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.align: center
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-pos: "H"

library(ggplot2)

# Ensure 'player_type' is a factor
final_data$player_type <- as.factor(final_data$player_type)

# Create the plot
strike_rate_plot <- ggplot(final_data, aes(x = t20_strike_rate, fill = player_type)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
    labs(x = "T20 Strike Rate", y = "Density", fill = "Player Type") +
    facet_wrap(~ player_type) +
    theme_minimal()

# Save the plot
ggsave("other/graphs/strike_rate_distribution.png", strike_rate_plot, width = 6, height = 4)

# Display the plot
strike_rate_plot

same issue
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the issue persists, the most likely causes are:

Column Name Mismatch: The column player_type may not exist in final_data or is being misinterpreted.
Data Type Issue: The player_type or t20_strike_rate column may not be in the expected format.
Let's debug this step-by-step:

Step 1: Verify the Data Structure
Run the following commands to inspect the structure of the final_data dataset:

r
Copy code
str(final_data)
summary(final_data)
Check if:

player_type exists as a column.
t20_strike_rate exists as a numeric column.
Step 2: Rename Columns if Necessary
If player_type or t20_strike_rate has a different name or unexpected capitalization, rename it:

r
Copy code
colnames(final_data) <- tolower(colnames(final_data)) # Standardize to lowercase
colnames(final_data)

# Rename specific columns if needed
final_data <- final_data %>%
  rename(player_type = `your_actual_column_name`, 
         t20_strike_rate = `your_actual_t20_column_name`)
Step 3: Check for Missing Values
Filter out rows with missing values in t20_strike_rate or player_type:

r
Copy code
final_data <- final_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(t20_strike_rate) & !is.na(player_type))
Step 4: Ensure player_type is Categorical
Convert player_type to a factor if it isn’t already:

r
Copy code
final_data$player_type <- as.factor(final_data$player_type)
Step 5: Modify the Plot Code
Here’s the updated ggplot2 code:

r
Copy code
#| label: fig-strike-rate-distribution
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of T20 and ODI Strike Rates by Player Type"
#| fig.width: 6
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.align: center
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-pos: "H"

library(ggplot2)

# Create the plot
strike_rate_plot <- ggplot(final_data, aes(x = t20_strike_rate, fill = player_type)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
    labs(x = "T20 Strike Rate", y = "Density", fill = "Player Type") +
    facet_wrap(~ player_type) +
    theme_minimal()

# Save the plot
ggsave("other/graphs/strike_rate_distribution.png", strike_rate_plot, width = 6, height = 4)

# Display the plot
strike_rate_plot
Step 6: Save and Re-run
After making these changes, save the Quarto document and re-render it.

If the Problem Persists:
Please share the output of the following commands for additional debugging:

r
Copy code
str(final_data)
summary(final_data)
colnames(final_data)
head(final_data)
This will help pinpoint whether the issue is due to the dataset or the plotting code.

this the colums do not match the actual data... what is wrong?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The issue seems to be that the order or number of columns in the dataset final_data does not match the manual renaming of the column headers in your script. Specifically:

The dataset you are using (final_data) might have columns in a different order or different names than those specified in your renaming step: c("Player", "Player Type", "Match Type", "Strike Rate", "Total Balls Faced").
Your final_data likely includes a column that does not correspond to one of these labels or is missing one of them.
Steps to Fix the Issue:
Inspect the Structure of final_data Run the following command in your R session to check the actual column names and structure of final_data:

r
Copy code
str(final_data)
This will reveal the actual column names and order.

Match Column Names to the Data Update your renaming logic to align with the actual column names in final_data. For example:

r
Copy code
colnames(final_data) <- c("Striker", "T20 Strike Rate", "ODI Strike Rate", "Total Balls Faced", "Player Type")
Ensure that the names match the intended dataset's structure.

Debug the Sampling Logic If sampling rows, verify the dataset’s content and select relevant rows to prevent mismatched data.

Updated Script Assuming the correct column names are "striker", "t20_strike_rate", "odi_strike_rate", "total_balls_faced", "player_type", the following script aligns with the data:

r
Copy code
#| label: tbl-analysis-sample
#| tbl-cap: "Sample of Analysis Data"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Randomly sample 5 rows from the loaded data
sample_data <- final_data %>%
  sample_n(5)

# Rename columns for clarity
colnames(sample_data) <- c("Striker", "T20 Strike Rate", "ODI Strike Rate", "Total Balls Faced", "Player Type")

# Display the table
knitr::kable(sample_data, row.names = FALSE)
Verify with These Steps:
Run str(final_data) to confirm the actual column structure.
Cross-check the displayed table after running the corrected script.
Ensure the structure aligns with your expectations before rendering the Quarto document again.
If issues persist, verify the upstream cleaning or loading step of the final_data to confirm the dataset was constructed correctly.

this is how my actual final data is organised
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Looking at your actual data structure, the columns are already named and organized as follows:

striker
t20_strike_rate
odi_strike_rate
total_balls_faced
player_type
If you want to display a sample table from this dataset in your Quarto document, here's how you can modify your code to match the actual column structure and create a descriptive table:

Updated Quarto Code for Table
r
Copy code
#| label: tbl-analysis-sample
#| tbl-cap: "Sample of Analysis Data"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Randomly sample 5 rows from the loaded data
sample_data <- final_data %>%
  sample_n(5)

# Rename columns for clarity (optional, since column names are already clear)
colnames(sample_data) <- c("Striker", "T20 Strike Rate", "ODI Strike Rate", "Total Balls Faced", "Player Type")

# Display the table
knitr::kable(sample_data, row.names = FALSE)
Key Adjustments:
Column Names: No renaming of columns is needed unless you want to make them title-cased for presentation. Your data already has clear column names (t20_strike_rate, odi_strike_rate, etc.).
Random Sampling: sample_n(5) is used to pick 5 random rows from your final_data dataset.
Final Presentation: You can directly use the dataset without additional transformation.
Run this updated code, and it should correctly display a sample table with columns matching your actual dataset. If issues persist, ensure that final_data is correctly loaded and reflects the structure shown in your screenshot.

set seed for reproducivility
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To ensure reproducibility when randomly sampling rows, you can set a seed using the set.seed() function. Below is the updated code with a seed added:

Updated Quarto Code with Seed for Reproducibility
r
Copy code
#| label: tbl-analysis-sample
#| tbl-cap: "Sample of Analysis Data"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(42)

# Randomly sample 5 rows from the loaded data
sample_data <- final_data %>%
  sample_n(5)

# Rename columns for clarity (optional, since column names are already clear)
colnames(sample_data) <- c("Striker", "T20 Strike Rate", "ODI Strike Rate", "Total Balls Faced", "Player Type")

# Display the table
knitr::kable(sample_data, row.names = FALSE)
Explanation:
Reproducibility: set.seed(42) ensures that the same 5 rows are sampled each time the document is rendered. You can replace 42 with any integer of your choice.
Consistency: The rest of the code remains the same, ensuring compatibility with the actual dataset structure.
This will generate the same random sample every time, which is critical for ensuring consistency in academic papers and reproducible research.

# Introduction

The sport of cricket has evolved greatly in recent times. Traditionally played over the course of 5 days, new, shorter formats are becoming increasingly popular due to their accessibility and faster pace of play. One Day International (ODI) and T20 formats are foremost among these formats - consisting of one innings of 50 overs and 20 overs respectively for either side. [@icc_three] All three formats, Test, ODI, and T20 present different challenges and require different skill-sets. Lasting 5 days, test matches require endurance, patience and strategy. In comparison, T20 cricket is much more exciting, with batsmen 'aiming for boundaries' as the teams try to score as many runs as possible in this short format. ODI cricket is a balance of the two - while relatively fast, strategy is key and slower play is more prevalent. [@behind] 

A batter's strike rate is a key performance indicator of their ability to score runs. It is defined as the 'runs per 100 balls' they face. [@sportmakers] For example, if a batter scores 100 runs in 50 balls, their strike rate can be calculated to be 200. Given the differences in strategy between formats, it is common to expect differences in strike rates. Longer formats generally have lower strike rates, and shorter formats higher. But how well do strike rates translate across formats, particularly for top-performing players compared to the rest of field? This is of particular interest, not only in evaluating individual player adaptability, but in understanding how skills in one format can be extrapolated to another.

This paper aims to investigate whether how well strike rates translate from T20 to ODI formats, for top-performing players compared to their peers. Specifically, we aim to estimate the difference in ODI strike rate attributable to 1) T20 Strike Rates, 2) Player Group (whether they are a top performing batter or not), and 3) the interaction between the two factors. Our estimate is the conditional effect of T20 Strike Rate on ODI Strike Rate, adjusted for player type, while accounting for player-specific variability.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Data Selection and Sourcing

Data used in this paper has been sourced from the reputable cricket database, CricSheet, [@cricsheet]. Created by Stephen Rushe, CricSheet is an open-source platform providing detail ball-by-ball data for 17,944 cricket matches. Contained in the database were 2,858 One Day International matches and 3,856 T20 International matches. This paper focuses on the male cricket matches, with 2,391 Male ODIs and 2,499 Male T20 match data downloaded as CSV files. This data set is particularly well-suited for this study because it ensures consistent measurement across matches, detailed coverage of player-level performance, and a large sample size, enabling robust statistical analysis of performance differences across formats.

Additional details on the data selection process and a step-by-step guide to access and download the data are provided in [@sec-data-details].

## Raw Data

Below are samples from the raw data regarding ODI matches after all raw csv files of individual match data were combined. The data is split into logical groups for clarity, but are all part of the same data frame.

### Match Information

@tbl-raw1 contains basic information about the match: match ID, season, start date, venue, innings, and ball. So, the first row would give match information of Match ID 1131279 at the ICC Academy in the 2017/2018 season, on the 1st of January 2023. The ball that the data captured is the 4th ball from the 44th over, in the first innings.

{r}
#| label: tbl-raw1
#| tbl-cap: "Raw Data - Sample Match Information"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Display match information
knitr::kable(match_info, row.names = FALSE)


### Batting and Bowling Teams
@tbl-raw2 is about the batting team, bowling team, and key players involved at the time of the delivery. The first row can be understood to show that the time of delivery 44.4 of Match 1131279 (correponding to row 1 in @tbl-raw1), the batting team is India, the bowling team is New Zealand, the Striker is V Kohli, the other batsman (or the non-striker) is SS Iyer, and the Bowler is TA Boult. 
{r}
#| label: tbl-raw2
#| tbl-cap: "Raw Data - Sample Batting and Bowling Teams Information"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Display batting and bowling teams information
knitr::kable(bat_bowl_info, row.names = FALSE)


### Runs and Extras
@tbl-raw3 contains the runs scored, extras such as wides, no-balls, byes, leg-byes, and penalties. So for the same ball in @tbl-raw1 and @tbl-raw2, 1 run was scored by V Kohli. There were no extras, wides, no balls, byes, legbyes, or penalties.
{r}
#| label: tbl-raw3
#| tbl-cap: "Raw Data - Sample Runs and Extras Information"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Display runs and extras information
knitr::kable(runs_extras_info, row.names = FALSE)


### Wicket Details
@tbl-raw4 contains information about wickets, including the type of dismissal and the players involved. For each of the 3 balls displayed in this sample there were no wickets or players dismissed.
{r}
#| label: tbl-raw4
#| tbl-cap: "Raw Data - Sample Wicket Details"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Display wicket details information
knitr::kable(wicket_info, row.names = FALSE)



## Cleaning 

### Desired Structure of Analysis Data
Refer to the "Sketches" section of the repository. There was an understanding of how the dataset needed to be transformed in order to get it ready for analysis through our model. he desired structure of the data aimed to include the following key variables: player name, player type, match type, strike rate, and total balls faced. Below is an example of a representation of the desired structure:

{r}
#| label: tbl-desired
#| tbl-cap: "Desired Structure of Analysis Data"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Example of the desired table structure
desired_structure <- data.frame(
  Player = c("Player A", "Player A", "Player B", "Player B"),
  Player_Type = c("Top 100", "Top 100", "Non-Top 100", "Non-Top 100"),
  Match_Type = c("T20", "ODI", "T20", "ODI"),
  Strike_Rate = c(140.0, 90.0, 120.0, 75.0),
  Total_Balls_Faced = c(1200, 1200, 800, 800)
)

# Clean column names to remove underscores
colnames(desired_structure) <- gsub("_", " ", colnames(desired_structure))

# Create the table
kable(desired_structure, align = 'lccrr') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")


### Filtering on Balls Faced

The first step after downloading raw data files and combining them into large T20 and ODI ball by ball data files was to filter players who had a large enough sample size across formats. That is to say, only those who meaningfully participated. Importantly we wanted to exclude players whose sample size of balls faced were too few, as these observations could skew the findings from the paper. Therefore, players were required to meet a minimum threshold of 200 balls faced in T20 matches and 500 balls faced in ODI matches. The combined balls faced in both formats needed to be above a threshold of 700. In doing so, we avoid noise from low-sample sizes. The library dplyr, [@R-dplyr], was used to filter and aggregate the data.

The 'mean' function was used to calculate the average T20 Strike Rate and average ODI strike rate. Missing or null values were exlcuded using 'na.rm = TRUE'. 

Because part of are model is concerned with differences between top performing players and their peers, we obtain the Top 100 batsmen before y ranking them based on the average of their T20 and ODI strike rates. Here, the 'mutate' function was used to calculate ranks and assign each player as either 'Top 100', or 'Non-Top 100'. 

### Structuring the Final Dataset

The arrow package was used to save the cleaned data set as a Parquet file. [@R-arrow] The final cleaned dataset now included the columns "Player", "Player Type", "Match Type", "Strike Rate", "Total Balls Faced". @tbl-analysis-sample contains a sample of the first 5 rows of the final analysis data.

{r}
#| label: tbl-analysis-sample
#| tbl-cap: "Sample of Analysis Data"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(42)

# Randomly sample 5 rows from the loaded data
sample_data <- final_data %>%
  sample_n(5)

# Rename columns for clarity
colnames(sample_data) <- c("Striker", "T20 Strike Rate", "ODI Strike Rate", "Total Balls Faced", "Player Type")

# Display the table
knitr::kable(sample_data, row.names = FALSE)


## Descriptive Statistics

### DistributAfter getting the data ready for analysis, it is useful to run some descriptive statistics to better understand the data. The plot below, @fig-strike-rate-distribution looks at how strike rates differ between match types, providing a density distribution.

#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-pos: "H"


### Comparison of T20 and ODI Strike Rates by Player Type

@fig-strikeratecomp compares the average strike rates for "Top 100" players and "Non-Top 100" Players, across both formats
{r}

The issue here is with the continue function in your ggplot script. This function might have been added inadvertently or is being misused. Ensure that you are not using an invalid function name within the ggplot syntax.

To fix this issue, here’s the corrected script for your density plot:

r
Copy code
```{r fig-strike-rate-distribution, fig-cap="Distribution of T20 and ODI Strike Rates", fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig-pos="H"}
library(ggplot2)

# Create density plots for T20 and ODI strike rates
strike_rate_plot <- ggplot(final_data, aes(x = t20_strike_rate, fill = player_type)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(x = "T20 Strike Rate", y = "Density", fill = "Player Type") +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the plot
ggsave("other/graphs/strike_rate_distribution.png", strike_rate_plot, width = 6, height = 4)

# Display the plot
strike_rate_plot
This ensures the correct functionality of ggplot2. Specifically:

Removed continue: If this was added mistakenly or due to a package conflict, it has been corrected.
Check File Path: Ensure the "other/graphs" directory exists or is created before saving the plot.
Error Check: Run the code outside the document once to verify that the script works in your environment. If further errors occur, validate the columns (t20_strike_rate and player_type) in final_data to ensure they exist and are correctly formatted.
Re-run your Quarto document after fixing this code.

ok for the descriptive stats just write me r script to with a bar chart. the x axis will have top 100 players odi, and t20, and non-top 100 players odi and t20, the y axis will measure strike rates
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here's the R script to create a bar chart with the specified axes and data:

r
Copy code
```{r fig-strike-rate-bar, fig-cap="Comparison of Strike Rates for Top 100 and Non-Top 100 Players Across Formats", fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig-pos="H"}
library(ggplot2)

# Prepare the data for the bar chart
bar_chart_data <- final_data %>%
  mutate(
    Group = case_when(
      player_type == "Top 100" & !is.na(t20_strike_rate) ~ "Top 100 T20",
      player_type == "Top 100" & !is.na(odi_strike_rate) ~ "Top 100 ODI",
      player_type == "Non-Top 100" & !is.na(t20_strike_rate) ~ "Non-Top 100 T20",
      player_type == "Non-Top 100" & !is.na(odi_strike_rate) ~ "Non-Top 100 ODI"
    )
  ) %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarise(
    Avg_Strike_Rate = mean(c(t20_strike_rate, odi_strike_rate), na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Create the bar chart
bar_chart <- ggplot(bar_chart_data, aes(x = Group, y = Avg_Strike_Rate, fill = Group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", width = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "Player and Format Group", y = "Average Strike Rate", fill = "Group") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Save the bar chart
ggsave("other/graphs/strike_rate_bar_chart.png", bar_chart, width = 6, height = 4)

# Display the bar chart
bar_chart
Explanation:
Data Preparation:

The mutate function creates a new column, Group, to distinguish between "Top 100 T20", "Top 100 ODI", "Non-Top 100 T20", and "Non-Top 100 ODI".
The group_by and summarise functions calculate the average strike rate for each group.
Bar Chart Creation:

geom_bar(stat = "identity") creates a bar chart using the summarized data.
position = "dodge" ensures the bars are placed side by side.
Aesthetic Adjustments:

theme_minimal() creates a clean and minimalistic plot style.
The angle = 45 rotates the x-axis labels for readability.
Save and Display:

The plot is saved to the other/graphs folder and displayed.
Make sure the other/graphs directory exists or is created before running this code.

ggsave("other/graphs/strike_rate_bar_chart.png", bar_chart, width = 6, height = 4)

# Display the plot
bar_chart
Explanation:
Data Transformation:

pivot_longer reshapes the data so that t20_strike_rate and odi_strike_rate are in a single column (Strike_Rate), with a new column Match_Type specifying the format.
mutate creates a Group column combining player type and match type (e.g., "Top 100 T20").
Data Aggregation:

group_by and summarise compute the average strike rate for each group.
Bar Chart Styling:

geom_bar(stat = "identity") creates the bar chart based on pre-aggregated data.
theme_minimal and label adjustments ensure a clean presentation.
Output:

The plot is saved to other/graphs/strike_rate_bar_chart.png.
The plot is displayed inline.

#| fig.width: 6
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.align: center

#| fig-pos: "H"

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Ensure column names are correct in the final_data
# Prepare data for bar chart
bar_chart_data <- final_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(t20_strike_rate, odi_strike_rate),
    names_to = "Match_Type",
    values_to = "Strike_Rate"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    Match_Type = case_when(
      Match_Type == "t20_strike_rate" ~ "T20",
      Match_Type == "odi_strike_rate" ~ "ODI"
    ),
    Group = paste(player_type, Match_Type, sep = " ")
  ) %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarise(
    Avg_Strike_Rate = mean(Strike_Rate, na.rm = TRUE),

  )

# Save the plot to the "other/graphs" folder
ggsave("other/graphs/strike_rate_bar_chart.png", bar_chart, width = 6, height = 4)

# Display the plot
bar_chart
Adjustments Made:
pivot_longer Transformation:

Ensure that t20_strike_rate and odi_strike_rate columns are correctly converted into a long format for plotting.
case_when for Match_Type:

Explicitly maps match type column names to "T20" and "ODI".
group_by and summarise:

Calculate the average strike rate for each player type and match type combination.
Improved Aesthetics:

Rotate x-axis labels for better readability.
Use theme_minimal for a cleaner visual presentation.
Error Prevention:

na.rm = TRUE ensures that missing data does not cause calculation errors.
.groups = "drop" prevents unnecessary grouping issues.
Saving and Displaying:

Save the chart to the other/graphs folder, then display it inline.
Common Issues and Fixes:
File Path Issue: Ensure the final_data object is correctly loaded and matches the dataset structure.
Column Name Mismatch: Check that t20_strike_rate, odi_strike_rate, and player_type are spelled exactly as in your dataset.
Saving Directory: Confirm that the other/graphs folder exists before saving. If not, create it with dir.create("other/graphs", recursive = TRUE) before ggsave.
Let me know if further debugging is needed!

#| fig-cap: "T20 vs. ODI Average Strike Rates by Player Group"
#| fig.width: 6
#| fig.height: 4

# Display the plot
strike_rate_bar_chart
Explanation of the Code:
group_by and summarise:

Groups the data by player_type ("Top 100" and "Non-Top 100").
Calculates the mean strike rate for both T20 (t20_strike_rate) and ODI (odi_strike_rate) formats.
pivot_longer:

Reshapes the summary data into a long format for plotting (one row per player_type and Match_Type combination).
Bar Chart (ggplot):

aes(x = Match_Type, y = Average_Strike_Rate, fill = player_type) specifies match type on the x-axis, strike rate on the y-axis, and groups by player_type.
geom_bar(stat = "identity") creates bars based on the values provided.
Saving the Plot:

Ensures the other/graphs folder exists with dir.create before saving the plot.
Display:

Displays the chart inline after saving.
This script will generate a bar chart with four bars: T20 and ODI strike rates for both "Top 100" and "Non-Top 100" players. Let me know if adjustments are needed!






You said:
the doc runs but the plot isn't showing up??
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the Quarto document runs without errors but the plot doesn't show up, here are some possible reasons and their solutions:

1. Check the ggsave() Call
ggsave() saves the plot to a file but does not display it in the document. Ensure the plot is also explicitly printed in the code.
Update the end of the code block:

r
Copy code
# Save the plot
dir.create("other/graphs", showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)
ggsave("other/graphs/strike_rate_bar_chart.png", strike_rate_bar_chart, width = 6, height = 4)

# Explicitly display the plot
strike_rate_bar_chart
2. Ensure the ggplot2 Plot is Rendered
Some environments require you to explicitly print the plot. This is typically done automatically in Quarto or RMarkdown, but explicitly calling the object ensures it renders.
Add print(strike_rate_bar_chart) as the last line of the chunk if the plot isn't displaying:

r
Copy code
# Display the plot
print(strike_rate_bar_chart)
3. Set Correct Chunk Options
Ensure the Quarto chunk options do not suppress the plot rendering. Specifically:
fig.align, fig.cap, fig.width, and fig.height should match your intended output.
echo: false only hides the code but does not suppress plots.
Example chunk options:

r
Copy code
#| label: fig-bar-analysis
#| fig-cap: "T20 vs. ODI Average Strike Rates by Player Group"
#| fig.width: 6
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.align: center
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-pos: "H"
4. Check ggsave() Path
Ensure the plot is saved in the expected location:
Verify that the directory other/graphs exists and the plot is saved as strike_rate_bar_chart.png.
You can manually check with:
r
Copy code
file.exists("other/graphs/strike_rate_bar_chart.png")
5. Clear the Environment and Re-Knit
RStudio or Quarto might retain old variables or states. Clear the R environment with rm(list = ls()) and re-run the document.
Final Example for the Code Block
Here is a final, polished version of the R script:

r
Copy code
#| label: fig-bar-analysis
#| fig-cap: "T20 vs. ODI Average Strike Rates by Player Group"
#| fig.width: 6
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.align: center
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-pos: "H"

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Calculate average strike rates for each player type and match type
average_strike_rates <- final_data %>%
  group_by(player_type) %>%
  summarise(
    T20 = mean(t20_strike_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    ODI = mean(odi_strike_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(T20, ODI),
    names_to = "Match_Type",
    values_to = "Average_Strike_Rate"
  )

# Create the bar chart
strike_rate_bar_chart <- ggplot(average_strike_rates, aes(x = Match_Type, y = Average_Strike_Rate, fill = player_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", width = 0.7) +
  labs(
    x = "Match Type",
    y = "Average Strike Rate",
    fill = "Player Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the plot
dir.create("other/graphs", showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)
ggsave("other/graphs/strike_rate_bar_chart.png", strike_rate_bar_chart, width = 6, height = 4)

# Explicitly display the plot
strike_rate_bar_chart
If the Issue Persists:
Recheck if the file is rendered correctly by Quarto.
Check if there are suppressed warnings or messages from ggplot2. If errors persist, feel free to share details!

    `ODI Strike Rate` = mean(odi_strike_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  rename(`Player Type` = player_type)

# Display the summary table
knitr::kable(average_strike_rates, row.names = FALSE)
Changes:
Renamed Columns:
player_type → Player Type
Avg_T20_Strike_Rate → T20 Strike Rate
Avg_ODI_Strike_Rate → ODI Strike Rate
This will make the table look more professional and user-friendly.

Ensure the model is well-explained, justified, appropriate, and balanced in complexity—neither overly simplistic nor unnecessarily complicated—for the situation. Variables should be well-defined and correspond with those in the data section. Explain how modeling decisions reflect aspects discussed in the data section, including why specific features are included (e.g., using age rather than age groups, treating province effects as levels, categorizing gender). If applicable, define and justify sensible priors for Bayesian models. Clearly discuss underlying assumptions, potential limitations, and situations where the model may not be appropriate. Mention the software used to implement the model, and provide evidence of model validation and checking—such as out-of-sample testing, RMSE calculations, test/training splits, or sensitivity analyses—addressing model convergence and diagnostics (although much of the detail make be in the appendix). Include any alternative models or variants considered, their strengths and weaknesses, and the rationale for the final model choice.

Model Justification
Why this model?
This linear regression model is well-suited for our research question because it directly captures the relationship between T20 and ODI strike rates while accounting for player type. The inclusion of the interaction term allows us to test whether the relationship between T20 and ODI strike rates differs for "Top 100" versus "Non-Top 100" players, reflecting potential differences in adaptability across formats.

Variable Selection
The chosen predictors correspond directly to variables introduced in the Data section:

T20 Strike Rate is included to test its direct influence on ODI performance.
Player Type (Binary) enables comparison between the top-performing batters and their peers.
Interaction Term reflects our hypothesis that the relationship between T20 and ODI strike rates may vary between the two groups.
Assumptions
This model makes the following assumptions:

Linearity: The relationship between T20 and ODI strike rates is linear for both player types.
Independence: Observations are independent, which may not hold if some players appear multiple times in the data.
Homoscedasticity: The variance of residuals is constant across all levels of T20 strike rate.
Normality of Residuals: Residuals are normally distributed.
Potential Limitations
Independence: If players have multiple observations, this independence assumption may be violated. A mixed-effects model might be more appropriate in such cases.
Interaction Effect: This assumes that differences between player groups are captured by a single interaction term, which may oversimplify more complex patterns.
Unmeasured Variables: Factors like player experience or match conditions, which could influence ODI strike rates, are not included.
Model Validation
To validate the model, we:

Check Residuals: Examine residual plots for linearity and homoscedasticity.
Diagnostics: Calculate 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  and Adjusted 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  to assess goodness of fit.
Alternative Models: Explore mixed-effects models (detailed in Appendix) to account for players with multiple observations.
Why not a more complex model?
A simple linear model balances interpretability with predictive power, making it suitable for this study. While a mixed-effects model could account for repeated measures by player, our analysis suggests that most players in the dataset appear only once, reducing the need for such complexity.

# Model {#sec-model}

## Model Set-Up

To investigate how T20 strike rates translate into ODI strike rates, we fit a linear regression model. This model examines the relationship between a player's **ODI Strike Rate** (\(Y\)) and three explanatory variables: **T20 Strike Rate** (\(X_1\)), a binary indicator for player type (\(X_2\)), and their interaction (\(X_1 \times X_2\)).

The mathematical representation of the model is as follows:

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \beta_3 (X_{1i} \cdot X_{2i}) + \epsilon_i
$$

Where:
- \(Y_i\): The ODI strike rate of player \(i\).
- \(X_{1i}\): The T20 strike rate of player \(i\).
- \(X_{2i}\): A binary indicator of player type, where \(X_{2i} = 1\) for "Top 100" players and \(X_{2i} = 0\) otherwise.
- \(X_{1i} \cdot X_{2i}\): The interaction term between T20 strike rate and player type.
- \(\beta_0\): The intercept, representing the predicted ODI strike rate for "Non-Top 100" players with a T20 strike rate of 0.
- \(\beta_1\): The main effect of T20 strike rate, representing the change in ODI strike rate for every 1-unit increase in T20 strike rate among "Non-Top 100" players.
- \(\beta_2\): The main effect of player type, representing the difference in ODI strike rate between "Top 100" and "Non-Top 100" players when T20 strike rate is 0.
- \(\beta_3\): The interaction effect, representing how the relationship between T20 and ODI strike rates differs for "Top 100" players.
- \(\epsilon_i\): The residual error, assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and constant variance \(\sigma^2\).

We fit the model using the `lm()` function in R, implemented in the **Base R** package, as follows:

```{r}
# Fit the linear model
strike_rate_model <- lm(
  formula = odi_strike_rate ~ t20_strike_rate + player_type_binary + t20_strike_rate:player_type_binary,

what about our model assumes linearity? 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In your model, the assumption of linearity stems from the use of the linear model (lm) in R. This assumption implies that the relationship between the independent variables (predictors) and the dependent variable (response) can be adequately described using a straight line or linear equation. Here's how this assumption is embedded in your model:

Linearity in the Model

​
 (T20 Strike Rate×Player Type (Binary))+ϵ
assumes that:

Main Effects:
There is a linear relationship between the T20 Strike Rate and the ODI Strike Rate. Specifically, for every unit increase in the T20 strike rate, the ODI strike rate changes by a fixed amount (
𝛽
1
β 
1
​
 ).
Similarly, the effect of Player Type on ODI strike rate is assumed to be additive and linear (
𝛽
2
β 
2
​
 ).
Interaction Term:
The interaction effect between T20 Strike Rate and Player Type (
𝛽
3
β 
3
​
 ) is also modeled linearly. This means the change in the relationship between T20 Strike Rate and ODI Strike Rate for Top 100 vs. Non-Top 100 players is assumed to vary in a straight-line fashion.
Why the Linearity Assumption Matters
Predictor-Response Relationship: It assumes that ODI Strike Rate changes proportionally (linearly) with changes in T20 Strike Rate and Player Type, with no significant curvature in the data.
Simplified Relationship: This assumption simplifies the modeling and interpretation, making it easier to explain the effects of predictors.
Potential Violations of Linearity
While linearity is a key assumption, it may not always hold in real-world data. For example:

The relationship between T20 Strike Rate and ODI Strike Rate could be non-linear, especially if there are diminishing or compounding effects.
Player performance might exhibit thresholds or plateaus, which would violate the linearity assumption.
Addressing Linearity in Practice
To test and address the assumption of linearity:

Diagnostic Plots:

Plot residuals vs. fitted values to check for patterns. A random scatter indicates linearity; a pattern suggests a violation.
Transformations:

If linearity is violated, consider applying transformations (e.g., log, square root) to the predictors or response variable.
Non-linear Models:

If linearity is inadequate, explore non-linear models such as polynomial regression or generalized additive models (GAMs).
Assumptions Summary in Context
The assumption of linearity makes your model interpretable and computationally efficient, but care must be taken to validate it. Tools like residual diagnostics and alternative modeling approaches can help ensure that the linearity assumption is not misleading your results.

expand on the residuals normally distributed assumption
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Residuals Normally Distributed Assumption
In a linear regression model, one of the key assumptions is that the residuals (errors) are normally distributed. The residuals are the differences between the observed values of the dependent variable and the values predicted by the model. For your model:

Residual
=
Observed ODI Strike Rate
−
Predicted ODI Strike Rate
Residual=Observed ODI Strike Rate−Predicted ODI Strike Rate
This assumption is crucial because it affects the validity of statistical inference, including hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, and p-values. Here's an expanded explanation of this assumption in the context of your model:

What Does Normality of Residuals Mean?
Definition:

The residuals should follow a normal distribution (bell-shaped curve) with a mean of zero (
𝜇
=
0
μ=0).
Mathematically, this is expressed as:
𝜖
∼
𝑁
(
0
,
𝜎
2
)
ϵ∼N(0,σ 
2
 )
where 
𝜖
ϵ is the residual, and 
𝜎
2
σ 
2
  is the variance of the errors.
Implication:

For any fixed combination of predictors (e.g., a given T20 Strike Rate and Player Type), the variability of the ODI Strike Rate around the predicted value should be normally distributed.
Why Is This Assumption Important?
Statistical Inference:

The normality of residuals underpins the accuracy of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. For example:
𝑡
t-tests for the significance of regression coefficients (
𝛽
1
,
𝛽
2
,
𝛽
3
β 
1
​
 ,β 
2
​
 ,β 
3
​
 ) assume that residuals are normally distributed.
Confidence intervals for predictions also rely on this assumption.
If the residuals are not normal, the 
𝑝
p-values and confidence intervals may not be reliable.
Model Fit:

Normal residuals often indicate that the model adequately captures the relationship between the predictors and the dependent variable.
How to Check Normality of Residuals
Histogram or Density Plot:

Plot a histogram of the residuals. A bell-shaped curve indicates normality.
Q-Q Plot:

A Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plot compares the quantiles of the residuals to the quantiles of a standard normal distribution. If residuals are normal, the points should align roughly along a 45-degree line.
Statistical Tests:

Perform tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to formally assess normality. Keep in mind, though, that these tests can be sensitive to sample size.
Residual vs. Fitted Plot:

While not directly for normality, this plot checks if residuals are randomly scattered around zero, indicating other assumptions (e.g., homoscedasticity) are met.
What If Residuals Are Not Normal?
Robustness of Linear Models:

Linear regression is somewhat robust to minor violations of normality, especially with large sample sizes (central limit theorem). However, extreme deviations can still bias inference.
Transformations:

Apply transformations (e.g., logarithmic or square root) to the dependent variable or predictors to normalize residuals.
Alternative Models:

If residuals remain non-normal, consider using models that do not require this assumption, such as:
Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)
Quantile Regression
Non-parametric regression
Bootstrapping:

Resampling methods like bootstrapping can provide valid confidence intervals and p-values without relying on the normality of residuals.
Potential Causes of Non-Normal Residuals
Omitted Variables:

Key predictors missing from the model can introduce systematic bias in residuals, deviating them from normality.
Non-linearity:

If the relationship between predictors and the response is not linear, the residuals may not be normal.
Heteroscedasticity:

If the variance of residuals changes across levels of the predictors, this can distort normality.
Outliers:

Extreme values can heavily influence residuals, making them non-normal.
Addressing Normality in Your Model
For your model on ODI Strike Rates:

Check Residuals:
Create a histogram, Q-Q plot, and residual vs. fitted plot to visually assess normality.
Investigate Deviations:
Identify possible sources of non-normality, such as non-linear relationships or outliers.
Model Alternatives:
If normality is significantly violated, consider using a robust regression model or transforming the data.
By addressing potential deviations from normality, you can improve the reliability and interpretability of your results.

## Model Justification

We attempt to capture the relationship between T20 Strike Rates and ODI Strike Rates, while accounting for player type using a dummy variable. Further, the inclusion of the interaction term directly tackles the research question, allowing us to test whether the relationship between T20 and ODI Strike Rates differs between groups - demonstrating potential differences in their adaptability.

In designing this model, we make the following assumptions: 

1. Linearity in Coefficients: We assume that there exists a linear relationship between T20 Strike Rates and ODI Strike Rates. The coefficient $\beta_1$ captures this. Additionally, the effect of player type, $\beta_2$, is also assumed to be linear. Furthermore, the coefficient of the interaction term, $\beta_3$, is also modeled linearly. @sec-model-details runs a diagnostic plot to check for linearity. 

2. Residuals are Normally Distributed: This is to say that the variability of ODI Strike Rate around the predicted value we fit using the model should be normally distributed, around 0. @sec-model-details plots a histogram of the residuals - a bell shaped curved implies normality. 

3. Homoscedacity: 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Model Justification (Continued)
Homoscedasticity:

This assumption implies that the variance of the residuals remains constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be roughly equal regardless of the T20 Strike Rate or Player Type. If this assumption is violated (i.e., if the residuals exhibit patterns such as a funnel shape), the model may suffer from inefficiency, and confidence intervals could become unreliable. We examine this assumption in @sec-model-details using a residuals vs. fitted values plot, where randomly scattered points indicate homoscedasticity.
Independence of Errors:

We assume that the residuals (errors) are independent of one another. This means that the outcome (ODI Strike Rate) for one player does not influence the outcome for another player. Violations of this assumption could occur if, for example, multiple observations are dependent within players or teams. Independence is less of a concern here, given that each observation pertains to a specific player’s performance and is treated as independent. However, if multiple observations for the same player exist, this assumption could be violated, which is why random effects might be necessary in future iterations of the model.
Correct Model Specification:

We assume that all relevant predictors (e.g., T20 Strike Rate and Player Type) are included and that the functional form of the model is appropriate. Omitting key predictors or using an incorrect functional form can bias the coefficients and invalidate the results. For example, if there are other variables influencing ODI Strike Rates (e.g., match conditions or player form), their omission could lead to biased estimates.
No Multicollinearity:

We assume that the independent variables (T20 Strike Rate and Player Type) are not highly correlated. Severe multicollinearity can make it difficult to estimate individual coefficients accurately. While the dummy variable for Player Type and the T20 Strike Rate are conceptually distinct, any interaction between these terms is also modeled to reduce potential issues.
Limitations of the Model
Simplistic Nature:

The model is relatively simple, focusing only on T20 Strike Rates, Player Type, and their interaction. Other potentially relevant factors (e.g., opposition team strength, venue, or match pressure) are excluded, which could limit the explanatory power of the model.
No Random Effects:

The model assumes that each observation is independent and does not account for random player-level effects. For players with multiple observations, a mixed-effects model might better capture within-player variability.
Residual Distribution Assumption:

While we assume residuals are normally distributed, real-world data often deviates from this assumption. Violations of normality could affect hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, though robust methods or transformations could mitigate this.
Homogeneity Across Player Types:

The model assumes that the relationship between T20 Strike Rates and ODI Strike Rates is uniform within each player type. However, individual players within the "Top 100" or "Non-Top 100" groups may exhibit significant variability.
Potential for Overfitting:

With relatively few predictors, the risk of overfitting is minimal. However, the inclusion of interaction terms and the focus on player type could result in overfitting if the sample size is small or unbalanced across groups.
Why This Model?
This model strikes a balance between complexity and interpretability. By focusing on T20 Strike Rates, Player Type, and their interaction, we directly address the research question while keeping the model understandable and explainable. Future iterations could incorporate additional predictors or random effects to improve accuracy and generalizability, but for the scope of this analysis, the current model provides a solid foundation for hypothesis testing and insight generation.

Additional model diagnostics and alternative specifications are discussed in @sec-model-details.

## Fitted Values

To understand the results of the model, we begin by examining the fitted values. These are the predicted ODI Strike Rates for each player based on the T20 Strike Rates, Player Type, and their interaction. The fitted values are computed using the following equation:

\[
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{T20 Strike Rate} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Player Type Binary} + \beta_3 \cdot (\text{T20 Strike Rate} \times \text{Player Type Binary})
\]

where:
- \(\hat{y}\) is the predicted ODI Strike Rate,
- \(\beta_0\) (Intercept) = 54.87,
- \(\beta_1\) (T20 Strike Rate Coefficient) = 0.19,
- \(\beta_2\) (Player Type Binary Coefficient) = 19.36,
- \(\beta_3\) (Interaction Term Coefficient) = -0.038.

The fitted values provide insight into how well the model captures the observed data. Below is a table of a sample of the observed ODI Strike Rates and their corresponding fitted values, grouped by Player Type.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-fitted-values
#| tbl-cap: "Sample of Fitted Values and Observed ODI Strike Rates"

Key Insights from the Model
Intercept (
𝛽
0
β 
0
​
 ):
The model's intercept of 54.87 suggests that the predicted ODI Strike Rate for a Non-Top 100 player with a T20 Strike Rate of 0 would be approximately 54.87. While not realistic in practice, this provides a baseline value for the model.

T20 Strike Rate Coefficient (
𝛽
1
β 
1
​
 ):
A one-unit increase in the T20 Strike Rate is associated with an increase of 0.19 units in the ODI Strike Rate for Non-Top 100 players, assuming the other variables remain constant.

Player Type Coefficient (
𝛽
2
β 
2
​
 ):
Top 100 players, on average, are predicted to have a 19.36 higher ODI Strike Rate compared to Non-Top 100 players, assuming the T20 Strike Rate is held constant. However, the p-value (0.185) suggests that this effect is not statistically significant.

Interaction Term (
𝛽
3
β 
3
​
 ):
The interaction term coefficient of -0.038 indicates a slight decrease in the effect of T20 Strike Rate on ODI Strike Rate for Top 100 players compared to Non-Top 100 players. However, the lack of statistical significance (p = 0.737) implies that this interaction is not strongly supported by the data.

Model Fit:

The model explains 50.3% of the variance in ODI Strike Rates (
𝑅
2
=
0.5025
R 
2
 =0.5025), indicating a moderate fit.
The residual standard error of 8.93 suggests that the model's predictions deviate, on average, by approximately 8.93 runs from the observed values.

i must load the model data in first at the beginning of the quarto file, the same way i did with the final data 

how do i save the output from running the model and then load it in? refer to my model script

# Load necessary libraries
library(lme4)
library(dplyr)
library(arrow)

# Load the dataset
data_path <- "data/processed_data/final_analysis_data.parquet"  # Adjusted to the correct path
model_data <- read_parquet(data_path)

# Ensure correct data types for categorical variables
model_data <- model_data %>%

To save the output of your model and later load it in your Quarto document, follow these steps:

Step 1: Save the Model Output
In your model script, you have already saved the fitted model as an RDS file using:

r
Copy code
saveRDS(strike_rate_model, "models/strike_rate_model_simple.rds")
This saves the model in the models/ directory.

Step 2: Load the Model Output in Quarto
At the beginning of your Quarto file, similar to how you load the final_analysis_data, add the following code to load the saved model:

{r}
Copy code
#| include: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Load necessary libraries
library(lme4)
library(dplyr)
library(arrow)

# Load the model data
model_data_path <- here::here("data", "processed_data", "final_analysis_data.parquet")
model_data <- read_parquet(model_data_path)

# Load the saved model
model_path <- here::here("models", "strike_rate_model_simple.rds")
strike_rate_model <- readRDS(model_path)
Explanation
Model Data: You load the same dataset used to build the model (final_analysis_data.parquet).
Fitted Model: The readRDS function reads the saved RDS file, restoring the fitted model into your workspace.
This ensures the model and its outputs are available for use in your Quarto document.

Explanation of Graphs
Predicted vs. Observed: This graph visually compares the fitted model values to the actual observed values.
Effect of T20 Strike Rate by Player Type: Highlights the interaction effect of player_type and t20_strike_rate.
Residuals Distribution: Helps validate the normality assumption of residuals. A bell-shaped curve would indicate that the residuals are normally distributed.
These plots provide a comprehensive view of the model's output, showing its predictive performance and highlighting key relationships in the data.

The error invalid argument type typically suggests an issue with the input data to the function, possibly related to the aes() mapping in the ggplot2 call. Let's ensure that the player_type_binary column is correctly formatted as a factor and that t20_strike_rate and predicted_odi_strike_rate are numeric.

Below is an updated and corrected version of the code for the plot:

{r}
Copy code
#| label: fig-t20-vs-odi-player-type
#| fig-cap: "Effect of T20 Strike Rate on Predicted ODI Strike Rate by Player Type"
#| fig.width: 6
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.align: center
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-pos: "H"

library(ggplot2)

# Ensure correct data types
model_output <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    predicted_odi_strike_rate = predict(strike_rate_model),
    player_type_binary = factor(player_type_binary, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Non-Top 100", "Top 100")),
    t20_strike_rate = as.numeric(t20_strike_rate),
    predicted_odi_strike_rate = as.numeric(predicted_odi_strike_rate)
  )

# Plot the effect of T20 Strike Rates by Player Type
ggplot(model_output, aes(x = t20_strike_rate, y = predicted_odi_strike_rate, color = player_type_binary)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "orange")) +
  labs(
    x = "T20 Strike Rate",
    y = "Predicted ODI Strike Rate",
    color = "Player Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
Key Changes
factor Conversion: The player_type_binary variable was converted to a factor with descriptive levels ("Non-Top 100" and "Top 100").
Numeric Conversion: Both t20_strike_rate and predicted_odi_strike_rate are explicitly converted to numeric to ensure compatibility with ggplot2.
Error Prevention: Cleaned up any potential formatting issues that might cause invalid input types.
If this still doesn't resolve the issue, we can debug further by checking the structure of model_output using str(model_output) to confirm that all variables are in the expected format.

how do i use str(model_output) to check

2/2

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To use str(model_output) to check the structure of your model_output data frame, follow these steps:

Insert the Code: Add the following line in your script or Quarto document where you want to debug:

{r}
Copy code
#| echo: true
str(model_output)
This will print the structure of the model_output data frame when you knit your document.

Run the Script: Run or knit your Quarto document. The output will show the structure of model_output.

Interpret the Output: The str() function displays:

Each column's name.
Each column's data type (numeric, factor, character, etc.).
A preview of the first few values in each column.
Example output:

ruby
Copy code
'data.frame':	292 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ t20_strike_rate         : num  142.57 150.36 160.12 ...
 $ predicted_odi_strike_rate: num  90.32 95.14 102.78 ...
 $ player_type_binary      : Factor w/ 2 levels "Non-Top 100","Top 100": 1 1 2 2 ...
 $ striker                 : chr  "A Symonds" "SA Yadav" "PD Salt" ...
What to Check:

Confirm that t20_strike_rate and predicted_odi_strike_rate are numeric.
Confirm that player_type_binary is a factor with levels "Non-Top 100" and "Top 100".
Ensure all columns are named correctly and contain valid values.
Adjust if Necessary: If any columns are of the wrong type (e.g., character instead of numeric), fix them by using mutate() from dplyr to cast the column to the correct type. For example:

{r}
Copy code
model_output <- model_output %>%
  mutate(
    t20_strike_rate = as.numeric(t20_strike_rate),
    player_type_binary = factor(player_type_binary, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Non-Top 100", "Top 100"))
  )
This will ensure your data is correctly formatted for the ggplot2 visualization!

To debug or verify your model_output using str(model_output), you should add it right after the model_output object is created. This will allow you to inspect the structure of the data before it is used in the plot.

Here’s the updated code with the str(model_output) line:

    t20_strike_rate = as.numeric(t20_strike_rate),
    predicted_odi_strike_rate = as.numeric(predicted_odi_strike_rate)
  )

# Debugging: Check the structure of the model_output

# Plot the effect of T20 Strike Rates by Player Type
ggplot(model_output, aes(x = t20_strike_rate, y = predicted_odi_strike_rate, color = player_type_binary)) +

  labs(
    x = "T20 Strike Rate",
    y = "Predicted ODI Strike Rate",
    color = "Player Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
Key Notes:
Placement: The str(model_output) is placed right after the model_output object is created.
Echo: Since the chunk is marked echo: false, the str(model_output) output won’t appear in the rendered document unless you change echo: true for debugging purposes.
Remove After Debugging: Once you’ve verified the structure of model_output and fixed any issues, you can safely remove the str(model_output) line.

The error Error in -title : invalid argument to unary operator suggests that there is an issue with the YAML header in your Quarto document. YAML headers should start with --- and should not include extra characters or incorrect formatting.

Here’s how the correct YAML header should look:

Common Causes and Fixes:
Ensure Proper Start and End of YAML Header:

The YAML block should start with --- and end with ---.
Make sure there are no extra dashes (-) or other characters.
Avoid Special Characters:

Ensure the text in the title, subtitle, or other fields does not include unescaped special characters like -, &, etc.
If the title includes dashes, they are fine as long as they are properly enclosed in double quotes (" ").
Verify Formatting:

Indentation matters in YAML. Ensure proper indentation for multi-line fields.
After fixing the YAML header, try re-running the document. Let me know if the issue persists!

Here’s how you can write about the regression summary in your results section:

Regression Summary
Table @tbl-regression-summary presents the coefficients from the linear regression model. The model estimates the relationship between T20 Strike Rates, Player Type, and their interaction on ODI Strike Rates.

The key components of the regression table include:

Intercept: The baseline ODI Strike Rate for non-top 100 players when the T20 Strike Rate is zero. While this value may not hold practical meaning (since a T20 Strike Rate of zero is rare), it helps to anchor the model.
T20 Strike Rate: The positive coefficient suggests that for non-top 100 players, a higher T20 Strike Rate corresponds to an increase in the ODI Strike Rate. Specifically, for every unit increase in the T20 Strike Rate, the ODI Strike Rate is expected to increase by the estimated coefficient, holding other factors constant.
Player Type (Top 100 vs. Non-Top 100): The coefficient for the binary player type indicates the difference in the baseline ODI Strike Rate between top 100 and non-top 100 players. Although the p-value for this term is not significant at conventional levels, it suggests a trend worth considering.
Interaction Term (T20 Strike Rate × Player Type): The interaction term estimates how the relationship between T20 and ODI Strike Rates differs for top 100 players compared to non-top 100 players. The non-significant coefficient here suggests that the adaptability of top-performing players to ODI formats may not differ substantially from that of non-top 100 players in this dataset.
Interpretation of Results
From the regression table, we observe that:

T20 Strike Rates have a significant positive relationship with ODI Strike Rates, as indicated by a significant coefficient and a p-value well below 0.05.
The Player Type variable's coefficient is positive, indicating that top 100 players tend to have higher ODI Strike Rates compared to non-top 100 players. However, the lack of significance suggests that this difference may not be consistent or strong across the sample.
The Interaction Term suggests that the relationship between T20 and ODI Strike Rates does not vary significantly by player type, indicating that adaptability between the formats is relatively consistent across top and non-top 100 players.
This section explains the implications of the regression coefficients, linking them back to your research question about how well strike rates translate across formats and whether this translation differs for top-performing players.

5.1 Interpretation of Coefficients
The regression model coefficients reveal significant insights into the relationship between T20 Strike Rates, ODI Strike Rates, and player type:

Intercept ($\beta_0$): The estimated intercept of 54.87 suggests that for a "Non-Top 100" player with a T20 Strike Rate of 0, the predicted ODI Strike Rate starts at this value. While such a scenario is implausible in real cricketing terms, the intercept provides a baseline for prediction.

T20 Strike Rate ($\beta_1$): The coefficient of 0.19 indicates that for every 1-unit increase in the T20 Strike Rate, the ODI Strike Rate for "Non-Top 100" players increases by approximately 0.19 units. This implies a moderate positive relationship between the two strike rates.

Player Type ($\beta_2$): The coefficient of 19.36 for the "Top 100" player type suggests a higher baseline ODI Strike Rate compared to "Non-Top 100" players. However, this effect is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.185), indicating variability in performance among the groups.

Interaction Term ($\beta_3$): The interaction term coefficient of -0.038 implies that the relationship between T20 and ODI Strike Rates weakens slightly for "Top 100" players. However, its lack of significance (p-value = 0.736) suggests that the adaptability of "Top 100" players does not markedly differ from "Non-Top 100" players in this context.

5.2 Interpretation of Graphs
The graphical results highlight model performance and assumptions:

Predicted vs. Observed ODI Strike Rates: The scatterplot shows the alignment of predicted ODI Strike Rates with the observed values. While there is a general correlation, discrepancies (residuals) at higher strike rates suggest potential areas where the model may be improved.

Residual Distribution: The histogram of residuals reflects a roughly bell-shaped curve centered around zero, supporting the assumption of normally distributed residuals. However, slight deviations from perfect symmetry may warrant further diagnostic checks.

5.3 Limitations
While the model provides valuable insights, there are limitations to consider:

Linearity Assumption: The model assumes a linear relationship between T20 and ODI Strike Rates. However, real-world cricket performance may involve non-linear dynamics influenced by match conditions, opposition strength, or player roles.

Unexplained Variability: The R-squared value (~0.50) indicates that approximately half of the variability in ODI Strike Rates remains unexplained by the model. Additional predictors such as match conditions or team strategies may enhance predictive power.

Interaction Significance: The non-significance of the interaction term limits insights into adaptability differences between "Top 100" and "Non-Top 100" players. Incorporating more granular data, such as player-specific roles or historical performance trends, might address this.

Generalizability: The analysis focuses on male cricketers in ODI and T20 formats. Findings may not generalize across other formats or to female cricketers.

Data Limitations: The combined data threshold (700 balls faced) reduces noise but excludes potentially relevant cases, such as emerging players or situational performances.

Despite these limitations, the findings contribute valuable insights into performance differences between player groups and the extent to which T20 skills translate to ODI success. Future research could explore non-linear modeling approaches, include additional predictors, and validate findings using out-of-sample data.

Summary of Findings
This study evaluates the relationship between T20 and ODI strike rates, emphasizing differences between top-performing ("Top 100") and non-top-performing players. The linear regression model captures the interaction between T20 strike rate and player type, enabling an analysis of whether T20 strike rate translates differently to ODI performance based on player ranking.

The regression analysis indicates a significant positive relationship between T20 and ODI strike rates for non-top players, as shown by the positive coefficient of the T20 strike rate variable (
𝛽
1
β 
1
​
 ). However, the interaction term (
𝛽
3
β 
3
​
 ) suggests no substantial evidence that the relationship differs for top players, as its coefficient is close to zero and statistically insignificant. These results highlight a broader consistency in how strike rates translate across formats, regardless of player ranking.

The fitted values demonstrate the model's predictive performance, with residuals distributed reasonably around zero. Top players show slightly higher residual variance, hinting at unexplained factors in their ODI performance that may not be captured by T20 strike rates or player type alone.

Insights on Player Adaptability
One important takeaway is the consistency in performance translation across formats. While top players have higher average strike rates in both T20 and ODI formats, their advantage may stem from broader skillsets rather than format-specific adaptability. The lack of significant interaction suggests that top players' ability to adapt to ODI cricket is not uniquely influenced by their T20 strike rates.

On the other hand, non-top players exhibit a steady improvement in predicted ODI strike rates with increasing T20 performance. This finding underlines the importance of developing strong T20 fundamentals for emerging players aspiring to excel in the longer ODI format.

Limitations of the Study
Despite the model's explanatory power, it simplifies the complexities of cricket performance. The use of strike rates alone may not fully capture batting quality or adaptability. For instance, contextual factors such as opposition strength, match situation, and playing conditions are not accounted for but can significantly affect performance.

The assumption of linearity and normally distributed residuals, while reasonable for the scope of this study, may not hold in reality. For example, extreme values or outliers in T20 strike rates could disproportionately influence predictions. Additionally, the dataset primarily focuses on male players, leaving unanswered questions about these dynamics in women's cricket.

Future Directions
Future research could incorporate additional performance metrics, such as average runs per dismissal or boundary rates, to paint a more comprehensive picture of player adaptability. Analyzing situational factors, such as batting positions or match phases, could also deepen the understanding of performance translation across formats.

Further, expanding the analysis to include women’s cricket and domestic leagues may reveal whether the findings generalize across broader contexts. Finally, exploring nonlinear models or hierarchical structures could address limitations in the current linear approach and better capture variability among top players.

Coefficient Interpretation
The linear regression model estimates the relationship between T20 and ODI strike rates while accounting for player type. The intercept (
𝛽
0
=
54.87
β 
0
​
 =54.87) indicates the expected ODI strike rate for a non-top player with a T20 strike rate of 0, providing a baseline estimate.

The coefficient for T20 strike rate (
𝛽
1
=
0.19
β 
1
​
 =0.19) suggests that, on average, a one-unit increase in T20 strike rate is associated with a 0.19-unit increase in ODI strike rate for non-top players. This positive relationship highlights that higher T20 strike rates generally correspond to better performance in ODIs for these players. The player type binary coefficient (
𝛽
2
=
19.36
β 
2
​
 =19.36) reflects the average difference in ODI strike rates between top and non-top players, controlling for T20 strike rate. Although this difference is not statistically significant (
𝑝
=
0.185
p=0.185), it provides an approximate measure of the expected performance gap.

The interaction term (
𝛽

0.037
β

​
 =−0.037) is not statistically significant (
𝑝
=
0.737
p=0.737), implying no evidence that the relationship between T20 and ODI strike rates differs substantially between top and non-top players.

Graph Interpretation
The predicted vs. observed ODI strike rates graph indicates how well the model fits the data. The points cluster around the 45-degree line, demonstrating that the model captures much of the variability in ODI strike rates. However, some outliers suggest that additional factors not included in the model may influence player performance.

The residual distribution plot shows that residuals are approximately centered around zero, indicating that the model predictions are unbiased on average. The distribution's bell shape suggests normality, a key assumption of the linear regression model. However, slight deviations at the tails hint at potential issues with capturing extreme values.

Broader Context
This analysis highlights how T20 performance relates to ODI performance and whether this relationship differs between top and non-top players. The results show that higher T20 strike rates generally translate to higher ODI strike rates for all players, underscoring the importance of foundational batting skills across formats. While top players exhibit higher average strike rates, the lack of a significant interaction term suggests that the mechanisms driving their adaptability may not differ fundamentally from non-top players.

These findings provide a framework for evaluating player adaptability and identifying skill sets that can support success across formats. For non-top players, building strong T20 fundamentals appears to be a pathway for improving ODI performance.

Limitations and Next Steps
The model relies on strike rates as the sole predictor, which may oversimplify batting performance. Factors such as match conditions, opposition quality, and batting order are omitted, limiting the model's ability to capture context-specific effects. Additionally, the linear structure may not adequately represent more complex relationships between variables, such as diminishing returns at extreme strike rate values.

Future research should explore models that incorporate additional predictors, such as boundary rates, match situations, and player experience. Including hierarchical structures could account for differences in player-level variability, and non-linear models may better capture patterns in the data. Expanding the analysis to other cricket contexts, such as domestic leagues and women's cricket, would test the generalizability of these findings.

Broader Context
This study examines the relationship between T20 and ODI batting performances, focusing on how T20 strike rates correlate with ODI strike rates among top 100 and non-top 100 players. The findings indicate that higher T20 strike rates are associated with higher ODI strike rates across both player categories, suggesting that skills honed in the T20 format can positively influence performance in the ODI format.

The evolution of cricket formats, particularly the rise of T20 cricket, has significantly impacted batting strategies and performance metrics. The introduction of T20 cricket has led to more aggressive batting approaches, with an increase in scoring rates and the frequency of boundary hits in ODIs. 
GODATAINSIGHTS
 This shift reflects a broader trend where skills and strategies from the shorter T20 format are being integrated into the longer ODI format, influencing how players approach their innings.

Environmental and task constraints, such as pitch conditions, ball type, and equipment modifications, also play crucial roles in batting performance. These factors can affect a player's ability to adapt their skills across different formats and conditions. 
SAGE JOURNALS
 Understanding these influences is essential for developing training and selection strategies that enhance player adaptability and performance across formats.

The findings of this study align with existing literature that emphasizes the interconnectedness of cricket formats and the transferability of batting skills. By highlighting the positive correlation between T20 and ODI strike rates, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of how modern batting techniques and strategies are evolving in response to the demands of different formats.

In summary, the study underscores the importance of adaptable batting skills that can transition effectively between T20 and ODI formats. This adaptability is increasingly vital in contemporary cricket, where players are expected to perform across multiple formats, each with its unique demands and challenges.

There are a fair amount limitations that are present in this model. First and foremost, the model uses strike rate as the sole predictor of batting performance - a top 100 player was defined purely off of strike rate. 

2/2

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
This approach ignores other critical aspects of batting performance, such as average runs scored, consistency, and the ability to perform under pressure. Players who may not have exceptionally high strike rates but consistently score runs over long periods could also be considered top performers in broader contexts. Thus, relying solely on strike rates could lead to an incomplete characterization of player quality.

Another limitation is the exclusion of external factors that influence batting performance. Variables such as match conditions, opposition strength, pitch characteristics, and the match situation (e.g., chasing a target or setting one) are not accounted for in the model. These factors can significantly impact a player's ability to score runs, especially in formats like ODI, where strategic gameplay often outweighs aggressive shot-making.

The interaction term included in the model to test the difference in the T20-ODI relationship between top 100 and non-top 100 players showed statistical insignificance. This suggests the model may lack the power or nuance to capture meaningful differences between these groups. The lack of explanatory power for this interaction could indicate that factors outside the model's scope drive differences between player categories.

Furthermore, the model assumes linearity in the relationship between T20 and ODI strike rates, which might oversimplify the actual dynamics. Batting performance could exhibit non-linear trends, especially as players adapt their approach to match contexts or as they age and gain experience. These dynamics are not captured in the current framework.

Lastly, the relatively small sample size, particularly within the top 100 players group, could limit the generalizability of the findings. Sampling bias may also be present if the players included in the dataset disproportionately represent specific regions or cricket-playing nations.

Next Steps
Future research should incorporate additional predictors of batting performance to develop a more robust model. Variables such as batting average, total runs scored, match conditions, and opposition strength could help provide a more comprehensive understanding of what drives player success across formats.

Exploring non-linear models or machine learning approaches may also help uncover more complex patterns in the data. For example, decision tree models or random forests could account for interactions and non-linearities more effectively than a simple linear regression.

Additionally, including a broader sample of players from various cricketing nations and leagues could enhance the model's generalizability. Stratifying the analysis by regions or leagues could also reveal regional or institutional differences in how players transition between T20 and ODI formats.

Finally, validation using out-of-sample testing or cross-validation techniques could strengthen the reliability of the findings. Incorporating time-series analysis to account for changes in playing styles over different eras of cricket might also provide valuable insights into how the sport and its players continue to evolve.

Here’s the structure and detailed content for your Appendix section in Quarto format.

Appendix {#sec-appendix}
Additional Data Details {#sec-data-details}
Source of Data
The datasets used in this paper are sourced from CricSheet, an open-source platform providing detailed ball-by-ball data for international cricket matches. CricSheet offers data for a variety of cricket formats, including Test, ODI, and T20 matches. The data spans matches across numerous years, capturing extensive details of players, teams, and matches.

Downloading the Datasets
To replicate the analysis, follow these steps to download the datasets:

Navigate to CricSheet: Visit the CricSheet website.
Locate Match Type Data:
Click on the relevant format (e.g., ODI, T20).
Download the ball-by-ball CSV files for each format under "Men’s Cricket" section.
Extract the Files:
The downloaded files will be in ZIP format.
Extract all files into a folder labeled according to the match format (e.g., ODI_matches/, T20_matches/).
Combine the Data:
Use R or Python scripts to load the individual CSV files and combine them into a single dataset.
The combination step ensures all match data for a format is consolidated into a single file.
Cleaning Process
Once downloaded, the raw datasets required cleaning to make them suitable for analysis:

Cleaning Steps:
Standardized column names using janitor::clean_names() to remove inconsistencies.
Removed matches with missing or incomplete data.
Added calculated variables such as total balls faced and strike rate for each player.
Accessing the Processed Data
For this analysis, processed data is available in the repository. To replicate the results:

Download the processed data files located under data/processed_data/.
Load the data using R, ensuring the file paths are correctly referenced in your script.
Sampling and Observational Data: Challenges and Methodology
Observational Nature of the Data
This analysis is based on observational data, meaning we did not conduct experiments or control variables. Observational data in sports analytics often arises from recorded performance metrics rather than randomized experiments. While this approach provides real-world insights, it comes with limitations such as unmeasured confounding variables and selection bias.

Sampling Challenges in Cricket Data
Sampling in cricket data presents unique challenges:

Inconsistent Match Representation: Players may participate in varying numbers of matches across formats, leading to unbalanced observations.
Player Inclusion Criteria: A threshold for balls faced was used to filter players with sufficient data (e.g., 200 balls for T20, 500 for ODI). This threshold minimizes noise but introduces potential bias by excluding players with fewer matches.
Team and Venue Effects: Factors like team strength or venue conditions could influence performance, but these are not explicitly modeled.
Idealized Methodology
To address these challenges in future work, an idealized methodology could involve:

Stratified Sampling:
Stratify players by their participation levels (e.g., high, medium, low match participation).
Ensure balanced representation across player groups for analysis.
Simulated Data:
Simulate player performances under controlled conditions to test hypotheses.
For example, simulate strike rates by varying contextual factors like opposition quality or pitch conditions.
Incorporating Hierarchical Models:
Use hierarchical (mixed-effects) models to account for team and venue effects.
This approach would allow for varying intercepts/slopes across teams or venues, reducing bias from unmeasured variables.
Linkages to the Literature
Studies in sports analytics often rely on observational data, leading to discussions about causality. While we cannot directly infer causal relationships (e.g., "Does T20 success lead to ODI success?"), our model provides evidence of associations. This aligns with literature in other sports analytics domains, such as Sabermetrics in baseball, where observational data informs player evaluations and decision-making strategies.

Limitations and Future Directions
Unmeasured Confounding: Variables such as weather, pitch conditions, and match stakes were not included but could influence results.
Selection Bias: Thresholds for balls faced may disproportionately exclude certain types of players (e.g., lower-order batsmen in ODIs).
Future Surveys or Data Collection:
Conduct surveys with players and coaches to understand adaptability across formats.
Collect contextual data during matches to improve the model's explanatory power.
This appendix provides a detailed overview of the data, its limitations, and potential methodologies for improvement in future analyses. It highlights the importance of careful sampling and thoughtful modeling in observational studies.

This structure ensures that the appendix is both detailed and well-organized, providing transparency about the data and methods used in the paper.

Here’s a revised abstract, updated introduction (focused on results and significance), a suggested title, and subtitle for your paper based on the provided content and guidelines.

Abstract
This paper investigates the extent to which batting strike rates in T20 cricket predict performance in the ODI format, focusing on differences between top 100 players and their peers. Using ball-by-ball data from 17,944 cricket matches, we construct a linear model to estimate ODI strike rates based on T20 performance, player type, and their interaction. Results reveal a positive relationship between T20 and ODI strike rates for all players, with top 100 players exhibiting consistently higher ODI rates. Surprisingly, the interaction term is not significant, suggesting that adaptability between formats may not differ substantially between player groups. These findings provide a clearer understanding of performance transferability across cricket formats and highlight the nuanced factors influencing player success.

Title
"Batting Performance Across Formats: Predicting ODI Strike Rates Using T20 Metrics"

Subtitle
"An Empirical Analysis of Top 100 Players and Their Peers"

Updated Introduction
The sport of cricket has seen significant changes with the rise of shorter formats like T20, which complement traditional formats like ODIs and Test matches. T20 cricket prioritizes high-impact, aggressive batting strategies, while ODIs require a balanced approach combining quick scoring with endurance. Understanding how skills translate across formats is essential for evaluating player adaptability and success.

In this paper, we examine how T20 batting strike rates predict ODI performance, focusing on differences between top-performing players and their peers. We model ODI strike rates using T20 strike rates, player type (top 100 or non-top 100), and their interaction, analyzing ball-by-ball data from nearly 17,944 matches. Our findings reveal that while T20 strike rates positively correlate with ODI performance, the interaction term suggests that adaptability does not differ significantly between top 100 players and others. This challenges the assumption that top players are uniquely skilled at transferring their performance between formats.

These findings are important for talent evaluation and team selection strategies in cricket. By quantifying the relationship between T20 and ODI performance, this research provides clarity on the dynamics of skill transferability. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses data selection and cleaning, Section 3 outlines the model, Section 4 presents results, and Section 5 discusses broader implications, limitations, and potential directions for future research.

can you write a paragraph that would go under the data section of the paper discussing how the data was measured - A thorough discussion of measurement, relating to the dataset, is provided in the data section. Please ensure that you explain how we went from some phenomena in the world that happened to an entry in the dataset that you are interested in.
ChatGPT
Measurement Discussion for Data Section
In this paper, the dataset represents a structured and quantitative attempt to encapsulate real-world cricketing phenomena, specifically player performances in T20 and ODI formats. The data from CricSheet originates from actual ball-by-ball records of cricket matches, which are rigorously recorded by official scorers during games. Each entry in the dataset corresponds to an observable event within a match, such as a ball delivered, runs scored, or a wicket taken. This provides a granular, play-by-play account of the game.

The process of translating these real-world cricketing events into dataset entries begins with match officials and scorers who log the outcomes of every ball. These logs are standardized and digitized into CSV files by CricSheet. Key variables, such as strike rate, player type, and total balls faced, were derived directly from these raw observations. For example, strike rate is calculated as the ratio of runs scored to balls faced, multiplied by 100—a straightforward transformation of raw data into a meaningful metric.

To ensure that the dataset aligns with the research objectives, additional preprocessing steps were undertaken. This included filtering players based on a minimum threshold of balls faced, ensuring that the dataset accurately reflects players with significant contributions across both formats. The raw data was then aggregated and cleaned using R, creating a structured dataset suitable for statistical modeling.

This approach ensures consistency and reliability in how the data was measured and prepared, allowing the analysis to directly reflect the underlying phenomena of interest: player adaptability and performance across cricket formats.
