Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets. The data used is from CricSheet, an open-source platform created by Stephen Rushe [@cricsheet]


**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The dataset was created to support cricket analytics and research, specifically to enable detailed analysis of cricket matches. It provides granular ball-by-ball data for T20 and ODI matches, allowing for performance modeling, strategy analysis, and player comparison.
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The dataset was created by Stephen Rushe and is made available through the CricSheet platform.
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - The dataset is publicly available and maintained by Stephen Rushe on a volunteer basis, with some support from donations.
4. *Any other comments?*
    - The dataset has become a critical resource for researchers and cricket enthusiasts, given its high level of detail and accessibility.

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- Each instance represents a ball-by-ball event in a cricket match, capturing details such as the batsman, bowler, runs scored, extras, and type of dismissal.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- The dataset contains 17,944 cricket matches, including 2,499 T20 Internationals and 2,391 ODIs, with millions of individual ball events.
	
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset is a comprehensive record of all publicly available international cricket matches but does not include all domestic or non-international games.
	
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance includes "raw" ball-by-ball data, capturing attributes such as match ID, over and ball number, batting team, bowler, batsman, runs, extras, and dismissal type.

5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No explicit labels are included, but data attributes such as runs and dismissals provide context for outcome modeling.

6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Data for some older matches might be incomplete, particularly regarding player details or venue information.

7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- Yes, instances are linked within a match via match ID and innings number.

8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- No explicit splits are recommended, but users often create splits by match type (ODI vs. T20) or time period.

9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Minor inconsistencies or missing data may exist for older matches due to incomplete record-keeping.

10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- Yes, the dataset is self-contained and does not rely on external resources.

11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No, the dataset consists of publicly available information.

12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- No, the data is focused on professional cricket and does not include sensitive personal information.

13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- Yes, it identifies players, teams, and match types.

14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- Yes, players are identifiable, but the data is already public.

15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset is designed to be open and accessible for a wide range of analytical uses.


**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
	- The data was sourced from official match scorecards and ball-by-ball commentary.

2. *What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?*
